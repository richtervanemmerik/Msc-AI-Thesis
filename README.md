This repository contains the official implementation of Enhancing Coreference Resolution
with Knowledge Graph Embeddings

---

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

### 1. Clone the Repository

```sh
git clone https://github.com/richtervanemmerik/Msc-AI-Thesis.git
```

### 2. Install Requirements
We recommend using conda for environment management.
```sh
conda env create -f kge_coref.yml
conda activate kge_coref-env
```

### 3. Download SpaCy Language Models

After installing the requirements, you need to download the required SpaCy models:

```sh
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
python -m spacy download en_core_web_lg
python -m spacy download en_core_web_trf
```


### 4. Data

- [LitBank](https://github.com/dbamman/litbank/tree/master/coref/conll)

Since those datasets usually require a preprocessing step to obtain the OntoNotes-like jsonlines format, the original maverick released a ready-to-use version:

### 5. Hydra
This repository uses [Hydra](https://hydra.cc/) configuration environment.

- In *conf/data/* each yaml file contains a dataset configuration.
- *conf/evaluation/* contains the model checkpoint file path and device settings for model evaluation.
- *conf/logging/* contains details for wandb logging.
- In *conf/model/*, each yaml file contains a model setup.
-  *conf/train/* contains training configurations.
- *conf/root.yaml* regulates the overall configuration of the environment.


### 6. Train
To train a Maverick model, modify *conf/root.yaml* and *conf/model/* with your custom setup. All model configuration can be set in *conf/model/*. Except the SpaCy linker. The default is en_core_web_trf. If you want a different model, change in *src/maverick/common/util.py*.


To train a new model, follow the steps in  [Environment](#environment) section and run the following script:
```
conda activate kge_env
python src/train.py
```
### 7. Azure ML

For Azure ML job submission, see [`azure_submit.py`](azure_submit.py) and [`run-maverick-job.sh`](run-maverick-job.sh).
